Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful daughter. 
Now it happened that he had to go and speak to the king, and in order 
to make himself appear important he said to him, "I have a daughter 
who can spin straw into gold."

The king said to the miller, "That is an art which pleases me well, 
if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to-morrow to my palace, 
and I will put her to the test."
